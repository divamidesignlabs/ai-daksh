# üåü Project Vision: DAKSH

> DAKSH ‚Äî Documentation & Artifact Knowledge Synchronization Hub

## 1. Why This Project Exists

DAKSH was born out of a recurring pain: we often found ourselves duplicating planning documents, losing traceability across teams, and struggling to maintain alignment between high-level epics and the nitty-gritty tasks. PRDs sat in one place, technical docs in another, and Jira issues often didn‚Äôt reflect either accurately.

This made onboarding harder, cross-functional reviews messier, and made it difficult to answer simple questions like ‚ÄúWhere is this feature defined?‚Äù or ‚ÄúWhat needs to change when this spec changes?‚Äù

DAKSH solves this by creating a structured and indexable bridge across all planning and implementation artifacts, using Markdown as the foundation ‚Äî making it visible, maintainable, and automatable.

Modern projects are also inherently dynamic ‚Äî new tasks emerge mid-sprint, strategies shift, and client inputs evolve. DAKSH is built to accommodate this flux, ensuring that documentation and task structures adapt with minimal resistance.

## 2. What Success Looks Like

A successful DAKSH rollout in the next 3‚Äì6 months would look like this:

- Every project at Divami starts with a generated `project-epics.ini` that defines epics and stories
- For each story, a `story-trd.md` and corresponding `trd-task-list.md` are generated and traceable
- Jira boards are automatically updated at key stages: epic/story creation, task generation, and task completion
- Copilot-marked checkboxes trigger code validation and controlled task completion in Jira
- Contributors onboard smoothly ‚Äî they know where to look, what to update, and how changes propagate
- Updates to any part of the system ‚Äî new constraints, tasks, or pivots ‚Äî are absorbed with clarity and minimal overhead
- Leadership has visibility into documentation health and feature delivery via consistent, linked artifacts

## 3. Who This Is For

DAKSH is built to support multiple personas across a project lifecycle:

- **Engineers**: to locate and update relevant technical artifacts
- **Product Managers**: to plan and monitor progress across epics and tasks
- **Designers**: to link design rationale and flows with corresponding PRDs
- **Leadership**: to review vision, roadmaps, and outcomes in a unified view
- **New Joiners**: to ramp up quickly with clean, navigable documentation

DAKSH is especially valuable for teams working in evolving problem spaces where adaptability and traceable documentation are key to momentum.

## 4. Guiding Principles

These principles define how DAKSH is designed and maintained. Each core persona benefits from a specific foundational principle:

- **Engineers**:  
  **Ease of creating and managing code across stories** ‚Äî Streamlined processes for code updates and tracking.

- **Product Managers**:  
  **Contextual links** ‚Äî Every document should link to related artifacts for easy navigation.

- **Divami Admins & Leadership**:  
  **Consistent structure** ‚Äî Use a common format across all projects for easy navigation and governance.

- **Clients**:  
  **One click updation of Jira** ‚Äî Changes in documentation should reflect in Jira with minimal effort.

---

### Additional Core Principles

- **Markdown-first**: Plaintext, readable, versionable source of truth  
- **Single-link traceability**: Every artifact can link upstream and downstream  
- **Minimal redundancy**: Avoid duplication by relying on centralized index  
- **Automation-aware**: Structure should support programmatic consumption and validation  
- **Visible by default**: No hidden tools, locked files, or local-only knowledge  
- **Contributor-friendly**: Anyone can contribute updates without complex processes  
- **Iterative improvement**: Start simple, evolve based on feedback and needs  
- **Open by default**: Documentation is accessible to all team members, fostering transparency  
- **Documentation as a living artifact**: It evolves with the project, not a one-time effort  
- **Focus on traceability**: Every change should be traceable back to the original requirement or task
- **Built for adaptability**: Changes like new constraints, pivots, or client inputs should propagate smoothly across all related artifacts ‚Äî epics, stories, tasks, and docs ‚Äî with minimum friction and maximum visibility

## 5. Long-Term Vision

Over time, DAKSH aims to evolve into:

- A standard across all internal projects ‚Äî every team follows the same traceability format
- A foundation for dashboards that visualize feature progress, doc coverage, and gaps
- A backbone for automation ‚Äî from syncing with Jira to generating reports
- A contributor-friendly ecosystem where planning and documentation live close to the work
- A resilient planning system that thrives even as project direction changes ‚Äî flexible enough to evolve, structured enough to remain coherent
- A source-controlled pipeline of `.ini` and `.md` files acting as a programmable interface to Jira, documentation, and automation
