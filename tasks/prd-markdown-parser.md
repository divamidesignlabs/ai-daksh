# Product Requirements Document: Markdown Parser for TRD Documents

**Story ID:** 1.2  
**Epic:** Core Parsing  
**Priority:** High (foundational/critical path)  
**Created:** 2025-07-03  

## Introduction/Overview

The Markdown Parser is a core component of the DAKSH system that enables parsing of Technical Requirements Documents (TRDs) and documentation markdown files with YAML frontmatter support. This parser will extract structured metadata from frontmatter, parse markdown content including task lists, validate internal links, and support both existing and newly generated markdown files. The parser is essential for maintaining traceability between epics, stories, and documentation artifacts.

## Goals

1. **Parse YAML frontmatter reliably** from markdown files with proper error handling
2. **Extract and validate task lists** in GitHub-style format with completion tracking
3. **Validate internal links and references** to ensure documentation consistency
4. **Support both existing and new markdown files** for backward compatibility
5. **Enable cross-referencing** between epics.ini stories and documentation frontmatter
6. **Provide detailed error reporting** with line numbers and actionable feedback

## User Stories

1. **As a developer**, I need to parse TRD markdown files with frontmatter so that I can extract structured metadata and link it to epic stories.

2. **As a developer**, I need to write front-matter in markdown files to retroactively link stories to their completion and maintain documentation consistency.

3. **As a developer**, I need to parse documentation markdown files with task lists and frontmatter so that I can track task completion and maintain documentation consistency.

4. **As a project manager**, I should consume project-epics.ini and link back the stories to documentation via frontmatter so that I can maintain traceability across all project artifacts.

5. **As a maintainer**, I need to validate internal links and references so that I can ensure documentation integrity and catch broken links early.

6. **As a user**, I need the parser to work with both existing and newly created markdown files so that I can maintain backward compatibility while adopting new workflows.

2.2. The parser must track task completion status (completed/incomplete)  
2.3. The parser must support nested task lists with proper indentation  
2.4. The parser must extract task descriptions and associated metadata  
2.5. The parser must enable task completion tracking for Copilot integration

3.3. The parser must validate file paths and existence of referenced files  
3.4. The parser must check for circular references in documentation  
3.5. The parser must provide detailed reports of broken or invalid links

### 4. Cross-Reference Integration
4.1. The parser must integrate with INI parser results for story-to-documentation mapping  
4.2. The parser must extract story_id references from frontmatter  
4.3. The parser must validate consistency between epic definitions and TRD frontmatter  
4.4. The parser must support bidirectional linking between stories and documentation

### 5. Error Handling and Reporting
5.1. The parser must collect all validation errors before reporting  
5.2. The parser must provide line numbers and column positions for errors  
5.3. The parser must include specific error descriptions and suggested fixes  
5.4. The parser must handle malformed markdown gracefully without crashing  
5.5. The parser must differentiate between warnings and critical errors

### 6. Documentation Generation Support
6.1. The parser must support updating existing documentation with new task information  
6.2. The parser must enable creation of new technical documentation  
6.3. The parser must update old documentation to point to new documentation paths  
6.4. The parser must maintain documentation version history and change tracking  
6.5. The parser must support writing frontmatter to existing markdown files without frontmatter  
6.6. The parser must enable retroactive story linking by adding story_id and completion metadata  
6.7. The parser must preserve existing markdown content while adding/updating frontmatter

### 7. Frontmatter Writing and Modification
7.1. The parser must support adding frontmatter to existing markdown files that lack it  
7.2. The parser must allow updating specific frontmatter fields without affecting others  
7.3. The parser must maintain proper YAML formatting when writing frontmatter  
7.4. The parser must create backup copies before modifying existing files  
7.5. The parser must validate written frontmatter for syntax correctness  
7.6. The parser must support batch operations for updating multiple files  
7.7. The parser must handle edge cases like files with existing malformed frontmatter

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

1. **Markdown rendering or HTML generation** - This parser focuses on extraction and validation, not presentation
2. **Support for non-YAML frontmatter formats** - Only YAML frontmatter is supported initially
3. **Real-time markdown editing** - The parser is designed for batch processing, not live editing
4. **External link validation** - Only internal links within the project are validated
5. **Markdown syntax extension** - Standard markdown syntax support only
6. **File system monitoring** - The parser processes files on-demand, not continuously

## Technical Considerations

### Dependencies
- **Python markdown library** for parsing markdown content
- **PyYAML** for frontmatter parsing and validation
- **pathlib** for file path operations and validation

### Performance Requirements
- Parser should handle files up to 10MB without performance degradation
- Batch processing of 100+ markdown files should complete within 30 seconds
- Memory usage should remain under 100MB for typical project sizes

### Integration Points
- Must integrate with existing INI parser for story cross-referencing
- Should work with nbdev notebook structure for documentation generation
- Must support CLI integration for validation commands

## Design Considerations

### Parser Architecture
- **Modular design** with separate components for frontmatter, content, and validation
- **Extensible validation framework** to support additional validation rules
- **Error collection system** for comprehensive error reporting
- **Caching mechanism** for improved performance on repeated parsing
- **Frontmatter writer component** for adding/updating YAML frontmatter in existing files
- **Backup and rollback system** for safe file modification operations

### Output Format
- **Structured data objects** for frontmatter, content, and task lists
- **Validation report objects** with detailed error information
- **Cross-reference mapping** between stories and documentation
- **JSON serializable results** for integration with other tools
- **File modification reports** detailing changes made to frontmatter
- **Backup file references** for rollback capabilities

## Success Metrics

1. **Parsing Accuracy:** 99.9% successful parsing of valid markdown files
2. **Error Detection:** 100% detection of malformed YAML frontmatter
3. **Link Validation:** 95% accuracy in detecting broken internal links
4. **Performance:** Process 100 markdown files in under 30 seconds
5. **Test Coverage:** 100% line coverage for all parser components
6. **Integration Success:** Seamless integration with existing INI parser
7. **Frontmatter Writing:** 100% successful frontmatter addition to files without existing frontmatter
8. **File Safety:** Zero data loss incidents during file modification operations

## Open Questions

1. **Should we support markdown files without frontmatter?** - Need to decide if frontmatter is required or optional
2. **How should we handle conflicting story IDs between epics.ini and frontmatter?** - Need conflict resolution strategy
3. **Should the parser automatically fix simple formatting issues?** - Consider auto-correction vs. strict validation
4. **How should we handle large documentation files?** - May need streaming or chunked processing
5. **Should we support custom frontmatter schemas?** - Consider extensibility for different project types
6. **What backup strategy should we use for file modifications?** - Consider backup location and retention policy
7. **How should we handle concurrent file modifications?** - Need file locking or conflict detection mechanism
